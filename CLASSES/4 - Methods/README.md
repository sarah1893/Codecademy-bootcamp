# Methods 

At this point, we have a `Dog` class that spins up objects with `name` and `behavior` properties. Below, we will add getters and a method to bring our class to life.

Class method and getter syntax is the same as it is for objects **except you can not include commas between methods.**

```
class Dog {
  constructor(name) {
    this._name = name;
    this._behavior = 0;
  }

  get name() {
    return this._name;
  }

  get behavior() {
    return this._behavior;
  }

  incrementBehavior() {
    this._behavior++;
  }
}
```

In the example above, we add getter methods for `name` and `behavior`. Notice, we also prepended our property names with underscores (`_name` and `_behavior`), which indicate these properties should not be accessed directly. Under the getters, we add a method named `.incrementBehavior()`. When you call `.incrementBehavior()` on a Dog instance, it adds `1` to the `_behavior` property. Between each of our methods, we did not include commas.
