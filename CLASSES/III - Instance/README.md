# Instance

Now, we’re ready to create class instances. An *instance* is an object that contains the property names and methods of a class, but with unique property values. Let’s look at our `Dog` class example.

```
class Dog {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
    this.behavior = 0;
  } 
}

const halley = new Dog('Halley'); // Create new Dog instance
console.log(halley.name); // Log the name value saved to halley
// Output: 'Halley'
```

Below our `Dog` class, we use the `new` keyword to create an instance of our `Dog` class. Let’s consider the line of code step-by-step.

- We create a new variable named `halley` that will store an instance of our `Dog` class.

- We use the `new` keyword to generate a new instance of the `Dog` class. The `new` keyword calls the `constructor()`, runs the code inside of it, and then returns the new instance.

- We pass the `'Halley'` string to the `Dog` constructor, which sets the `name` property to `'Halley'`.
 
- Finally, we log the value saved to the `name` key in our `halley` object, which logs `'Halley'` to the console.

Now you know how to create instances. In the next exercise, you will learn how to add getters, setters, and methods.
