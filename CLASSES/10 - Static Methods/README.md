# Static Methods

Sometimes you will want a class to have methods that aren’t available in individual instances, but that you can call directly from the class.

Take the `Date` class, for example — you can both create `Date` instances to represent whatever date you want, and call *static* methods, like `Date.now()` which returns the current date, directly from the class. The `.now()` method is static, so you can call it directly from the class, but not from an instance of the class.

Let’s see how to use the `static` keyword to create a static method called `generateName` method in our `Animal` class:

```
class Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    this._name = name;
    this._behavior = 0;
  }

  static generateName() {
    const names = ['Angel', 'Spike', 'Buffy', 'Willow', 'Tara'];
    const randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random()*5);
    return names[randomNumber];
  }
}
```

In the example above, we create a `static` method called `.generateName()` that returns a random name when it’s called. Because of the `static` keyword, we can only access `.generateName()` by appending it to the `Animal` class.

We call the `.generateName()` method with the following syntax:

```
console.log(Animal.generateName()); // returns a name
```

You cannot access the `.generateName()` method from instances of the `Animal` class or instances of its subclasses (See below).

```
const tyson = new Animal('Tyson'); 
tyson.generateName(); // TypeError
```

The example above will result in an error, because you cannot call static methods (`.generateName()`) on an instance (`tyson`).
