# Handlebars "If" block helper

So far, youâ€™ve only used Handlebars expressions to insert values in your templates. If you want to check for a specific object property before you insert a value, Handlebars provides you with the {{if}} helper block. The {{if}} helper is similar to the if conditional in JavaScript, but there is a difference in syntax:

```
{{#if argument}}
  // Code to include if the provided argument is truthy 
{{/if}}
```

Notice that the example above has both an opening {{#if}} expression and a closing {{/if}} expression. The code block between those expressions will be added to the final HTML template if the argument provided is truthy.
