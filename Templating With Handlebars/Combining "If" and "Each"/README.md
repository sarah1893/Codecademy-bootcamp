# Combining "If" and "Each"
In the previous exercises, you’ve mostly worked with individual expressions, however, you have the ability to combine expressions! In this exercise, you will combine the {{if}} block and the {{each}} block together in a single <script>!

Let’s revisit the code from the previous exercise. In this exercise, you’ll be adding an element to the languages array and adding a new property, modern, to all the elements. Then you will manipulate the Handlebars script to show different texts based on the modern property.
