Great work you now know the fundamentals of using Handlebars! Letâ€™s recap a few key points:

- Handlebars is an external library used to create templates which are a mix of HTML, text, and expressions.
- Handlebars uses expressions which are wrapped inside double braces like: `{{someVariable}}`
- A script tag with a type of `"text/x-handlebars-template"` is used to deliver a template to the browser.
- `Handlebar.compile()` returns a templating function from a template script intended for Handlebars.
- A template created from `.compile()` will take an object as an argument and use it as context to generate a string containing HTML.
- Handlebars has built in block helpers which can be included in a Handlebars script.
- Block helpers have a starting expression and an ending expression. The starting expression will have a `#` appears before a keyword. The ending expression will have the same keyword but with a `/` character to denote the end.
- The `{{if}}` will conditionally render a block of code.
- An `{{else}}` expression can be inserted into an `if` helper block and used as part of the conditional statement.
- `{{each}}` is another built-in helper expression which accepts an an array to iterate through.
- In the block helper functions, the `{{this}}` expression gives context and serves as a placeholder for the current value.
